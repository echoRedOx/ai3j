 This procedure is to override data pased in the PERSONAL.SIGCARD.PRO,
 specifically in the WRITEFORMDATA Procedure. Commands here must
 be in the same format as in the WRITEFORMDATA Procedure.
 This is used for customization since most times you can
 (if possible) set the values in the CUSTOMSETUP procedure above.

 Examples:
   FIELDNAME = "MYFIELD" CHARACTERDATA = "Hello SymFormPDF" CALL WRITECHARACTER
   FIELDNAME = "MYFIELD" MONEYDATA = $3.14 CALL WRITEMONEY

 This procedure is to send special JavaScript code to the PDF from.
 The code specified here will be executed after the field data is
 loaded into the fields. You can declare object variables that are

 Example:
   JSTEXT = "app.alert('Hello SymFormPDF JavaScript!');" CALL WRITEJS
